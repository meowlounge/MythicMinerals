## 🔎 QUICK INFOS

- Commits should **clearly describe the change**.
    - ✅ Good: `feat(frostium): added frostbite aura & mining speed boost`
    - ❌ Bad: `did some stuff`, `fixed a thing`

- ALWAYS **test before committing**.

- For large changes, **use feature branches**, then merge after testing.
    - Branch name: `feature/<ore-name>-logic`
    - Example: `feature/stellarium-boost-fix`
