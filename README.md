# TODO

~~- use datagen instead of hardcoding all loot tables and worldgen stuff~~ @prodbyeagle

- Armor sets should have specific buffs and debuffs
  - Mining Tools
  - Fighting sets

# INFO

- commits should be readable no ( did some things ), we want to know what happened in this commit.
- test if it works before commiting it.
- if it's a big feature, create a new branch to save the main branch from being ruined. (please test before final...)

# ORES

- ###  Frostium (Mining [Cold Biomes Only])
- ###  Fogstone (Armor [Humid Biomes only])
- ###  Voidstone (Boots = Faster)
- ###  Pyrostone (You are sensible)
- ###  Stellarium (It doesn't have debuffs)
